Just Another Introspections 


Now is the time to introspect a lot 

about life, about existence about love, 

etc. 


Am i another version of others or 

am i 

another version of myself. or am i 

another version of my own evolved self. 


I did try from different versions of 

myself JAI 1.0 2.0 3.0 etc..and lost 

count at some point of the number of 

iterations

Then I started to take each 

day as it 

came cause of the Pandemic, my 

personal 

the crisis along with my own 

family 

the situation has made each day 

seem like a 

a decade and each moment 

look like a 

Millenium if I had to speak 

in terms of 

hyperboles. 


so each moment 

it was a new version of 

I am being 

created. 

so the reason Just Another I 

nomenclature has been created by myself. 

It defines me and at the same time it 

also allows me to explore myself within 

my self.

The I - 

Then I was an indication 

of myself and 

different shapes it took 

as an acronym
These various I's could be 

mentioning 

few of my favorite ones 

I as 

an Iconoclast: The one who does 

not 

adhere to traditional rules. And the 

one 

who sets his own rules. 

I as an 

Imaginative person: The one 

whose mind 

is in the cloud most of the 

time, who 

lives in his world. The 

Alice in the 

wonderland to be precise.

I as an 

Innovative person: The one who 

is 

delighted by Innovative 

technologies, 

The one who likes to work 

with 

innovative minds.

I as an Introvert: The 

one who loves 

his own company and want 

to stay away 

from the crowd and loves 

his  cocoon 

so to speak, The world is 

very small and 

very big at the same time 

when you are 

enough for your self.

I as 

an Introspective: I like to 

introspect 

and try to understand my own 

thinking. 

thinking about thinking about 

thinking. 

To different levels. similar 

to 

Christopher Nolan's Inception which 

is 

also another I for an another day 

perhaps.

Just Another lends a certain 

levity to 

my existence. When I get too 

serious 

about stuff. I am sure many have 

walked 

this earth and many would walk on 

the 

earth after my death and many at the 

the same moment would have similar 

thoughts. 

So as a whole Just Another I 

is what i 

am - A combination of Just 

Another 

Individuals along with many 

variations of 

I - 

Further would explore 

the following I's

Just Another -

I - 

Infinite 
I - Invincible
I - Idiotic
I - 

Interesting 
I - Immaculate 
I - Isotope 
I 

- Irresistible 
I - Irreverant 


The rules 

of the game are not to be 

too self-

critical and too self 

deprecating, to be 

able to find one's 

own limitations and 

limitlessness
